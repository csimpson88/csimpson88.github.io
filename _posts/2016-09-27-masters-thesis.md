My Master's thesis has finally been published! You can view my thesis [here](/assets/docs/Simpson-2016-hinge-moment-cfd.pdf) or on [The University of Alabama Electronic Theses and Dissertations database](https://ir.ua.edu/items/b24e56da-42e8-45ef-861c-f32ff2a6d3e5).
I started this research with absolutely no CFD experience.
I am quite proud of the fact that I was able to learn enough that I am now considered by many to be an expert. 
When I look at how far I have come in the last three years, it truly amazes me.
I never thought I would learn so much.

Thanks to everyone who supported me while I worked on this research, and thanks for your continued support as I continue in my studies.
