# Spreadsheet Simulator (The name is available!)

## What is "Spreadsheet Simulator"

*Spreadsheet Simulator* is a first person/UI dominant game, where the player is an employee who completes various spreadsheet-related tasks as one of many employees at a mega corporation in the early days of spreadsheet tools. 
Their goal is to fulfill requests from their bosses and colleagues, solve problems, and uncover company secrets using the spreadsheet on their old trusty computer.
Players will have to decide whether to focus on individual gain or acting for the greater good as they make decisions.
The game will mostly take place in a computer terminal UI, with the occasional first-person experience such as physically to the supply closet to count inventory or taking a water break.
It will have narrative devices like those in *Papers, Please* in a corporate cube farm environment like *Office Space*.

## Design Pillars: What is Central to the Experience

We use design pillars to focus our design choices as we move through the project. For the purpose of this project, we want our design pillars to identify the types of fun or enjoyment which are key to the user experience.

Of the [14 forms of fun](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/fourteen-forms-of-fun), the following are the core pillars of this game

Pillar | Description
---|---
Immersion | Everything about the environment should make the player feel like they are in a 1980's corporate cube-farm job.
Intellectual Problem Solving | The player will have to solve spreadsheet-related problems, some of which affect future outcomes.
Creation | Offer players creative opportunities.
Discovery | Players should feel like they are uncovering something big.
Application of a Skill | Real spreadsheet skills should be applicable to this game.

## Audience and Market

The game is a single-player game intended for PC and designed to be played with mouse and keyboard. It will be sold on Steam.

This game will be aimed at an adult audience who grew up in the 80's and 90's, who are currently working in jobs that they probably feel unsatisfied in. The game will have strong messages about the evils of corporations and capitalism. To the target audience, it will play to the fantasy of screwing over their employer for personal gain or a chance to serve the greater good.

## Core Gameplay

The game is primarily played through the computer terminal interface at the player's cubicle. 
The player can (and may be required at times) move around the office using the WASD controls, but this is not the primary means of gameplay.

The player will be given tasks to complete in the spreadsheet program as the game progresses.
Some tasks will be requested by the player's bosses, and others will come from colleagues, investigators, etc.
There will be a variety of tasks for the player to perform.
Some ideas are listed below:

- count and document inventory (e.g. go to the supply closet and count the office supplies, and enter them into a spreadsheet)
- create/balance a budget
- track expenses
- find accounting errors
- falsify numbers
- make charts
- generate reports
- data entry
- calendar/schedule
- assigning roles
- forecasting
- calculations
- formatting
- that one guy who just wants you to paint a picture
- spreadsheet-based games (spreadsheet golf)

Other tasks can be developed at a later date, but this is considered the MVP (minimum viable product) version for the base game

The player will gain or lose favor (reputation) with their bosses and other characters depending on how they complete their tasks.
The player's actions will also determine things like whether they get a pay raise or pay cut, whether they get the corner office or the basement cubicle, etc.
Players will use money to affect their work environment, such as buying desk trinkets, a printer, a keyboard with a numpad, etc.
This gives players a reason to choose personal gain over the moral high ground

## Controls

When in front of computer:
- Mouse - controls cursor
- Left click - mouse click (no right click option)
- Keyboard buttons - as they are in real life - some may be unusable until better peripherals are purchased (e.g. numpad)

First person movement:
- WASD - move the player character around
- Mouse - first person look
- Space - interact

Note: there will be no jump, sprint, or crouch mechanics. This is an office setting, after all.

## Gameplay Balance and Pacing

The game is a single-player game, so the balance that needs to be struck is in the difficulty of the tasks given.
It should be accessible to people who are not familiar with spreadsheet tools, so there should always be an option to just fake it, or just not do a task altogether.
For players who know their way around a spreadsheet, there should be sufficient depth to keep them entertained.

Task difficulty should fluctuate up and down to give players a respite after a difficult task is completed.
Tasks should vary enough to keep it interesting, but some should be repeated often enough to convey that this job is ordinarily very mundane.

The goal is to give players enough content for a session to be at least 1 hour long, with replayability driving longer playtimes.
Replayability will come from player actions effectively locking them out of some future options.
Because of this, it needs to be obvious to the player that there are multiple exclusive options and numerous ways to complete the game.

## Character Designs

Characters will be portrayed only as 1980s video game illustrations (i.e. low-ish resolution monochromatic pixel art or ascii art).
Most interactions will be by email (yes it existed), bulletin boards, and landline phone calls.
There will be no 3D representation of any characters other than irrelevant NPC coworkers sitting in cubicles lifelessly carrying on with their work.

The game outside of the cubicle can be 3D or top-down/isometric 2D


## Setting & World

The game will take place in a late 1980s corporate office with high-wall cubicles and all the tech (or lack thereof) that comes with the era, such as dot-matrix printers, fax machines, dial-up modems, etc.

The game will aim to have one or more floors of an office building with cubicles, offices, windows, supply closet, etc.
However, the prototype and vertical slice versions of the game should only include the computer interface with email and spreadsheet apps.

## Tone & Aesthetics

The visual style and iconography of the game will be developed as the project progresses.

Initial inspirations include the beige, brown, green, white, and black color palettes of 1980's offices.
See [here](https://www.vintag.es/2019/05/1980s-offices.html) for some inspiration.

## Narrative

Large story TBD.
The player works for a huge corporation that is up to some very shady activity.
Some possible scandals are:
- large environmental disaster - like an oil company with spills, monsantos/glyphosate, 3M/teflon
- pharmaceutical company and a drug that has serious addition issues or long-term side effects
- defense contractor selling arms illegally
- fruit company involved in overthrowing small countries' governments (like bananas)
- financial crimes (like Enron, pump-and-dump schemes, pyramid schemes) 
- getting a far-right candidate elected president and then manipulating the president into doing things that benefit the company

Players will also receive requests from NPCs that are not their bosses. 
These will have their own narratives and mini-stories like the narratives in *Papers, Please*.

## Business Model

This is a premium game, which users will purchase once and then own for good.
The game will release as follows:
1. An initial limited-features free demo release to gain initial interest and traction.
2. A full release with a price TBD.
