# Game Ideas

## Spreadsheet Simulator

I this idea while working in spreadsheets all day every day for my day job.
The overqualified player works as a (insert job that works exclusively in spreadsheets here) at a large corporation.
The player receives requests from many colleagues for different spreadsheet-related produts, such as the examples below.

  - inventory (e.g. go to the supply closet and count the office supplies, and enter them into a spreadsheet)
  - budget
  - find errors
  - falsify numbers
  - make charts
  - generate reports
  - data entry
  - calendar/schedule
  - assigning roles
  - forecasting
  - calculations
  - formatting
  - that one guy who just wants you to paint a picture
  - spreadsheet-based games (spreadsheet golf)

The corporation is up to something nefarious.
The player can either help the corporation for personal gain (better office, more pay, etc.), or they can expose the company for the greater good at the personal expense (basement office, pay cut, etc.).

## Asking AI for help

I asked deepseek to generate 20 game jam themes, no more than 4 words each.
Below is the list.
Under each theme, I will generate at least one idea for a game with that theme.

1. Breathing Buildings
  - A city building game where the buildings are alive. Maybe the buildings are organic creatures that humans have cultivated into dwellings. Players need to consider building needs with their city planning.
  - A floating city that changes as buildings are moved around.
2. Memories as Currency
  - A game where players trade secrets for something. Maybe it's an info running game, where players must rely on their own memory and relay information to clients.
3. Time is Edible
  - A game where time stands still if the player is not eating (or time advances only when the player eats).
  - Conversely, a game where time is affected (stands still, slows down, speeds up) for some duration after eating
4. Your Reflection Lies
  - 
5. Gravity is Optional
  - Any game in space could fit this theme. I am not a big fan of it.
6. Colors Have Weight
  - weight could mean mass, influence, or impact.
7. The Last Alphabet
  - 
8. Echoes Create Reality
  - A game where the player navigates by echolocation (visualized in an eye-catching way)
  - A submarine game where the players have to navigate using sonar
  - A treasure hunting/salvage game where the player uses sonar to find and recover treasure at sea (or in a swamp, whatever)
9. Dreams Leave Fossils
  - a game where a player's body remains in the world after they die and revive
10. Silence is Contagious
  - 
11. Words are Alive
  - Mad Libs Dungeon - a rogeulike where room descriptions are Mad Libs-style fill-in-the-blanks that alter gameplay. The player inserts nouns/verbs to generate traps, enemies, or power-ups. Every run is unpredictably silly.
  - **Mad Libs Dungeon** - players start by filling in mad libs with no clues - "a monster", "a friend", "an object", etc. That then defines how the game or level will play.
12. The Moon is Listening
  - a game where the player, a werewolf, must go out at night, but does not want to transform. So he must avoid moonlight. The moon is sentient.
13. Shadows Betray You
  - game where shadows hurt you, so you have to stay in the light. You have abilities or weapons to light up shadows, but those will cast more shadows
  - stealth game where you are emit light, and shadows that would conceal a traditional player character give away your position
14. Music is Poisonous
  - a game where the player's abilities are different instruments, each with different effects against different enemies. The background music can interact in various ways. Sound design would be hard.
15. The Ocean Forgot
  - Treasure/Salvage game. Find and loot shipwrecks, upgrade your boat, and discover secrets.
16. Light has Mass
  - A game where light mass is exaggerated. For example, shining a light on a box can make it slide in that direction.
17. Thoughts Become Traps
  - A game that gets more difficult the longer you pause to think about it?
18. Machines Feel Lonely
  - you are the only survivng robot in a post-apocalyptic world. discover what happened through narrative devices
19. The Stars are False
  - celebrities are fake
  - the sky is not real
20. Nothing is Random
  -
