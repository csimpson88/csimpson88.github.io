This site is my personal blog and portfolio for my most notable projects.
Check out my posts for the work I am most proud of.

I am a researcher at heart, with a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, specializing in remote sensing, radar systems, image and signal processing, and algorithm development. 
I have experience designing, developing, and testing innovative systems, including drone-based ultra-wideband radar for soil moisture measurements and advanced SAR processing algorithms. 
I have worked professionally in the field as an engineer since 2021.
I love coding, and my strongest languages are Python, C++, Matlab, and GDScript. 

In my spare time, I enjoy travelling with my family, studying/practicing Chinese (我说中文说的不好), and working on miscellaneous projects.
Lately, I have been dabbling in game development, so keep an eye out here for what might be the next hit game (but probably not).
